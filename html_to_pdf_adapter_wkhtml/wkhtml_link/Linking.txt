The "wkhtmltopdf" crate needs to dynamically link to the "wkhtmltox" library. The version of the library should match
what is specified in the "wkhtmltopdf" create's docs (for v0.3.0 and v0.4.0 the v0.12.3 library should be used).


# Library downloads
https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases/0.12.3


Simply extract the downloaded file with something like 7zip and it should have the following content:
* "bin/wkhtmltox" (about 30 MB)
    - The dynamic library that must be present when the rust program is started or it will exit with a link error.
* "bin/wkhtmltopdf" (about 30 MB)
    - Standalone program to produce pdf files from html files.
* "include/"
    - Headers that were used with bindgen to produce the rust crate.
* "lib/wkhtmltox.lib" (about 100 kB)
    - Needed at rust program compile time.
